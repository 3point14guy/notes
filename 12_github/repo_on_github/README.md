# Exercise - Put your repo on GitHub
In this exercise we will take the repo we have been workign with and put it on GitHub

* **Create a GitHub account**
    - If you do not have a GitHub account, let's create one now at https://github.com/
    - You will have to verify your email address to complete the signup process

* **Create a repository**
    - Once logged in you have 2 ways to create a new repo.
        1. From the homepage click the "Start a project" button
        2. Go to your profile, click the repostories tab, then click the new button

* You should see a screen similar to the one below  
![Git Workflow](../../resources/images/create_repo.png)

* Provide a name for your repo and everything else can stay at the default values then click "Create Repository".

* You should then see the empty repository screen  
![Git Workflow](../../resources/images/repo_no_code.png)

* Since we already have a repo we are going to focun on the intructions underneath **â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line**

* First run the `git remote add origin YOUR_URL` as it's written on the screen
* Next we need to do our initial push with `git push -u origin master` to get our code on GitHub.
* Refresh the GitHub page for your repo and you shuold now see your code in place of the instructions.
