## Introductions
***slide 3***
Let's use this time to get to know everyone.

**Go around to each student and ask the talk about the following:**

1. Tell us two truths and a lie about yourself. (but not necessarily in that order!)
2. What types of software are you interested in developing and why?
3. What you have been doing this past year?
4. Why are you taking this course?
5. What programming or technical experience do you have?


## Ice Breaker - Machines
***slide 4***

1. Split the class into teams of 2 or 3 depending on the size of the class.
2. Teams should be standing up and in their respective groups. It's a team exercise. Let's see those teams.
3. Go around to each team and **Secretly** assign them a machine. These are typically household appliances or something similar. Here are some examples.
    * Toaster
    * Fridge
    * Washing Machine
    * Weed Whacker
    * Popcorn Machine
    * Juicer
    * etc...
    
4. Each team needs to act out or perform their machine one at a time for the rest of the class. They can't talk but can make the noises the machine would make. Each person must participate in the process.
5. As each team is performing, the rest of the class is to guess the machine the group is acting out.

## Why did we just do that?
***slide 5***

***Discussion Topics***  

The purpose of the Ice Breaker is to highlight critical thinking, working together, and breaking problems into small pieces. Basically the concepts It is also meant to be fun so have fun with it please. 

*Talk about why we do the ice breaker and how it relates to how we solve coding problems*

*Discuss student takeaways from this exercise*

***PRO TIPS***

* Encourage students to sit next to someone new everyday. This will help students learn from each other.
* Encourage students to talk through issues with their neighbors. Through helping each other they will help themselves retain the curriculum

## Keys to Success
***slide 6*** **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/6)**

This is advice that will help students be successful in the program and as a professional developer.

* This class is going to be tough.  
    - You’ve already invested a lot of money and now you’ll need to invest a great deal of time and mental effort. We are going to go over a tremendous amount of material at a very brisk pace.  In 8 weeks, we are going to go over what others cover in 2 or 4 year programs.  Of course, we’ll not be covering things in the same depth. We will show you the “how” of things much more than the “why.”  When you learned to drive, you probably didn’t spend a lot of time learning about Newtons 1st law about an object in motion stays in motion or how an internal combustion engine takes a small amount of fuel, mixes it with air in a chamber and applies a spark to ignite it.  The resulting explosion pushes a cylinder that in turn rotates a shaft and eventually causes the car to move.

    - Like hiking a mountain with a 40lb pack and not using the switchbacks. We’ll be taking a shortcut up the side of the mountain.  Once at the top, you’ll find you are actually only at the tip of the ice berg…there’ll be a lot more that you need to know.
* Get in the right mindset
    - Think about the long term big picture and dont let the short term frustration distract you
    - There will be many times when you feel frustrated in the short term…you have to keep the bigger goal in mind.  If I were to graph a very typical immersion experience…it might look like this.  There are hills and valleys and as time goes by, the valleys should be shallower and farther in-between.
* You **MUST** put in the time.
    At least 3 hours per day outside of class and some of you will put in much more than that.  The material builds on itself.  The first lessons are among the easiest, don’t be lulled into complacency. As easy as they are, we only scratch the surface of these topics.
* Take ownership of your education
* Try teaching/helping others. To teach is to learn!
* Pair program. Two minds are usally better than one. This type of thing is done a lot in professional environments
* Don't be afraid to fail. Most code doesn't run the first time. It's about the proccess, not about getting it to work the first time.
* Get out of your comfort zone. The more time you spend out of your comfort zone the bigger it gets.
* **ASK QUESTIONS!!** - 
    * Clarifying and deepening - Great!
    * Pontification or too specific - Save for Office Hours!
    * Pay attention when others ask questions: Do your best to answer that question to yourself.  By testing yourself this way, you see what you really know and if you’ve made wrong assumptions.
    * In fact, every time you run a block a code, you should be anticipating what result you will get.  Ask yourself what is going to happen when I run this? If you get the result you expected, great.  Many times you won’t and you’ll want to use the computer’s response to formulate your next steps.

* Be active and engaged in the development community. Go to meetups and stay on top of new technologies. Always be learning!


## What you should expect
***slide 7*** **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/7)**

Set expectations of what students should expect from the boot camp and its intructors

* Sessions will start on time 8AM and go to 11AM
* Instructors will show up before class starts
* Homework will be breifly reviewed at the start of each session. This will give an opportunity to address any questions. 
* Classes will be a mixture of lecture and hands on coding.
* We'll take a 10 minute break every hour.  It is important to give your mind a break. Please talk about something else, do something else.  It really makes a difference!
* Homework will be assigned at the end of class. So much of programming is solving problems and sometimes these problems are not solved easily or quickly.  You have to try from multiple approaches.  Also, leaving a problem for a while and coming back to it later often gives your brain time to process the problem subconsciously.  Therefore, I will be available for help, tips or hints on homework during the office hours after it is due.  
* Materials will be published in the Titus Portal (link in Useful Resources) after each piece of the curriculum has been delivered. (I have your usernames and passwords if you don't have them already.)
* We will build several projects during the bootcamp
    - Please feel free to work on as many of your own projects as you like for practice. 
* There will office hours for each session. Please take advantage of this time to get answers to any questions or address any concerns you may have. This is also a great time for you to give us feedback on how we are doing.
* If there are any issues about class that you don't want to talk to me about, reach out to the community organizer, Tracy. You should all have her contact info from her email.
* Communication will be via Slack

##Intoduction to some useful concepts
In this section we will touch upon some common conepts in the programming world. We will discuss what computer programming is, how the web works, and some common principles related to programming

## Intro to Programming
***slide 8*** **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/9)**

### Computer Programming
At a very high level computer programming is the concept of telling a computer through a programming language with a given set of instructions.

***Discussion Topics***  
*What are some things that come to mind when you hear the words "computer programming" or "writing software"?*
*What are some "tech" terms you've heard of that you are curious about?

## Are computers smart?
***slide 9***

Computers are fast, not smart. They only do what they are told, no more no less. I know computers can seem smart but that's because they were programmed to behave that way. Computers are really great at calculations but should probably leave the higher level thinking to us.

## Programming languages
***slide 10***

As discussed, in order to program a computer we need to use a programming language. There are a ton of programming languages in the world and some are more popular than others. For this class we will focus on a language called "Ruby". Ruby is a simple and very powerful object-oriented language.

***Discussion Topics***  
*Can anyone name any other programming languages?*  

*Can anyone explain the difference between a front-end and back-end language?*  *We'll get to the answer in just a bit...*

## Classroom Challenge 1
***slide 11***  **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/11)**

#### Exercise - Make a bowl of cereal
We are going to write out the instructions for making a bowl of cereal.  We are going to write these instructions for a computer, not a person.  We wont use a programming language just yet. We'll use pseudo-code; what we want to accomplish in our code, but written in English.
Be as specific as possible. Assume nothing. 

**Example**
> 1. Open panty
> 2. Locate Cereal
> 3. Chosse between Lucky Charms, Kix, or Cheerios.
> ...

Have the students read out their instructions and the instructor tells them where the computer will "throw an error."
## Classroom Challenge 2
***slide 12***

***Discussion Topics***  
*Discuss some of the solutions to the exercise and touch on how this process is similar to how we tell a computer what to do through a programming language.*

Computers only appear smart because of PROGRAMMERS!


## Markup Languages - Focus on HTML 
***slide 13*** 

There are several Markup languages out there. A couple of the most commonly known are HTML and XML. Markup languages put an opinion on how to format data in a text file usually for processing and presentation. They do this with the use of "tags" or "elements". HTML is the markup language we will focus on in this bootcamp.

**HTML Example**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

***Discussion Topics***  
*Discuss the structure and some of the tags in the HTML example*


## Client Server Model - How the web works
***slide 14*** **[graphic showing the 'web'](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13677/Fetching_a_page.png)**

When browsing the web, the client (your device) makes a request to a server (web server) which then responds to the client with the information requested. A client in this scenario would your computer, phone, tablet, or any similar device that has a web browser installed on it. You open your browser and request google.com and googles web servers then respond to you with the content that makes up google.com. When talking specifically about the web, HTTP Protocol that is used for communication between the client and server. HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. We don't need a deep understanding of the HTTP protocol but we should understand that it is a defined set of rules that outline how clients and servers talk to eachother as it relates to the web.

***Discussion Topics***  
*Great opportunity to draw this out on the whiteboard*  

## How Does the Web Work?
***slide 15***

The browser uses something called HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) which is the underlying technology that makes it possible for a client (your computer, laptop, smartphone) to interact with a server over the web. The server is where your programs run (i.e., your Ruby on Rails programs). 

With the HTTP protcol their is an agreement to connect, a request for data, and error messages for unfilled requests

 ***Discussion Topics*** 
*What is a protocol? Can you think of more protocols?*
*Discuss other protocols like FTP, SMTP, FTP*

## HTTP Verbs
***slide 16*** **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/16)**

* GET  - Retrieve items from resource.
* POST - Create new item in resource.
* PUT - Replace existing item in resource.
* PATCH - Update existing item in resource.
* DELETE - Delete existing item in resource.

When we work in Rails, we will be on the receiving end of these.

This relates to RESTful design. 

* RESTful design: Representational State Transfer.  Standards for building, maintaining and interacting with APIs. (Application-programmer interface)
* HTTP is the protocol that is most commonly used to implement the REST architecture.
* With RESTful design, you don’t need to know how all the underlying code works.  You need to know what type of request to send, where to send it and what type of data will be returned.

## So...Ruby and...Rails?
***slide 17***

Ruby and Rails are not the same thing. This section aims to talk Ruby and Rails and how they relate to each other.

* Ruby is our programming language.
* Rails is a web application framework, built on Ruby.
* We learn Ruby first because we’ll see the basic structure of this language throughout the Rails applications that we work with. Otherwise, we’ll be putting the cart before the horse!
* Ruby predated Rails by roughly a decade and was originally designed as an object-oriented programming language.

Ruby and Rails are not the same thing. This section aims to talk Ruby and Rails and how they relate to each other.

**Ruby**  

* Ruby is a programming language
* The code we write is in the Ruby language
* Ruby is an object-oriented
    - Object oriented programming: we model real world objects with virtual objects in our code.  Objects have attributes: characteristics of the object and they have methods: the actions you can take with those objects or their characteristics.

**Rails**  

* Rails is a web application framework.
* Provides a set of tools and functionality to rapidly develop web applications (Convention Over Congiguration).
* Rails is ***NOT*** a programming language
* Rails is written with Ruby

## A few rules of safety...
***slide 18*** **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/18)**

THIS IS A REALLY BAD SLIDE- Talk about convention over configuration first and then their bad analogy.

### Convention over Configuration
This is the concept that following conventions outlined by a full featured web framework can really speed up the development process. The framework has made a lot of decisions for you and your not stuck writing all that low lever configuration and boiler plate code.

This concept really comes into play when Ruby and Rails are combined. Ruby is a programming language and Rails is a web framework that is used with Ruby to build applications for the web. The framework has provided you all the building blocks for your application. You can just start using them and build an application in no time.

Has anyone here ever played with legos?
You can use legos for the analogy. Basic bricks are the configuration. No fancy shaped pieces. Just build all detail yourself. But to get good resolution, (good detail), you need to build whatever it is, BIGGER and use lots of bricks.

With convention, it's like buying one of those spaceship kits with all the fancy pre-molded pieces.  You have to do less thinking about how to build, you use less pieces, and you can get something that looks like a spaceship, pretty easily.

## The KISS Principle "Keep it simple, stupid"
***no slide***

The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore simplicity should be a key goal in design and unnecessary complexity should be avoided. By extension solve a simple version of a problem first and then build on that. This is the idea behind **MVP**, which is the idea of getting the most basic functions to market before adding complexity. 

***Discussion Topics***  
*Break problems down into small pieces. You want to get to the solution one piece at a time*

*Don't over-engineer. Build only the features you need for basic functionality. You can do the fancy stuff once the core functionality is solid*

##  The DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself" Principle
***slide 19***

It's a common occurance to catch yourself duplicating code in your software application. Sometimes you just need to do the same thing somewhere else in your code. This is where the DRY principle comes in. Rather than duplicating the code we should try to find a way to make that code re-useable. Making code re-useable makes it easier to maintain. You can now update code in one spot and it's fixed in all the places it is used in the application. You can imagine the incosistensies and errors that may occur if you had to remember all the places you need to update that duplicated code. 

***Discussion Topics***  
*Finding a balance between making code re-usable before making it work. As you start out I would prefer you repeat your code until the core functionality works. You can always improve after you have your proof of concept*


## Environment Check 1
***slide 20***  **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/20)**

***Reccommended bootcamp software***

* **[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)** - Text Editor used for writing code
* **[Chrome Web Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)** - The preferred browser for this bootcamp.

***Optional software installs for OSX***

* **[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)** - More features than the default termnial. Tabs and split screen are useful

***Recommended software installs for Windows***

* **[Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** - Linux like git command line experience on mac

## Envrionment Check 2
***slide 21***  **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/21)**

Let's take a few minutes to make sure our environments are configured properly. We are going to verify the versions of the software we need to complete this bootcamp. This will also give us a sneek peek at the command line.

**Verify versions of the following software**

***ruby (2.3)***
```sh
$ ruby -v
ruby 2.3.3p222 (2016-11-21 revision 56859) [x86_64-darwin14]
```

***rails (5)***
```sh
$ rails -v
Rails 5.0.1
```

***git (not picky on version)***
```sh
$ git --version
git version 2.8.1
```

** OSX Only **  

***xcode-select (2339 or higher)*** 
```sh
$ xcode-select -v
xcode-select version 2339.
```

***gcc*** 
```sh
$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr --with-gxx-include-dir=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.5.0
Thread model: posix
```

***rvm (1.28.0)*** 
```sh
$ rvm -v
rvm 1.28.0 (latest) by Wayne E. Seguin <wayneeseguin@gmail.com>, Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.io/]
```

***homebrew (>=1)***
```sh
$ brew -v
Homebrew 1.1.6-45-g9cce341
Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision c0e2a; last commit 2017-01-10)
```

## Just in case
***slide 22***

**Incase the above didn't go so well**  
Issues with student environments should be taken care of before class. If for some reason you run into issue please use cloud9 as a backup environment.

* **[Cloud9](https://c9.io/)** - A cloud based Development Environment

## Navigating Your Machine
***slide 23***

#### The command-Line
The command line is a quick, powerful, text-based interface developers use to more effectively and efficiently communicate with computers. Once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to navigate directories, run programs and launch
applications much faster than pointing and clicking. It may feel a bit awkward at first after years of relying on a GUI interface, but the more you use the command line the more comfortable you will feel.

## Essential Commands 1
***slide 24***

* **`cd directory_name`** - change directory
* **`cd ..`** - go one level up in the directory structure
* **`ls`** (`dir` in Windows) - list contents of current directory
* **`pwd`** - print current working directory
* **`mkdir directory_name`** - make a new directory
* **`touch file_name`** (`type NUL >> filename` in windows) - create a new file
* **`open`** (start in Windows) - opens file in default program

## Essential Commands 2
***slide 25***

* **`mv from_path to_path`** (`move` in windows) - move file or directory, also used to rename
* **`cp from_path to_path`** (`copy` in windows) - copy file or directory
* **`rm file_name`** (`del` in windows) - deletes a file an with some flags can delete directories as well. `rmdir` is available as well for directory removal
* **Up Arrow Key** - will scroll through history of commands, most recent command first.
* **subl.** - Opens directory or file in Sublime.

***Discussion Topics***  
*show how to use the `man` command to pull up the manual pages for these commands (e.g. `man ls`)*  

*show some examples with flags like `ls -lash` and how to find thos flags in the manual page*

***Discussion Topics***  
*Tab completion with the comman-line to speed things up*

*`history` command to show previous commands run*

*CTRL-C to exit an active command*

## Activity
***slide 26***  **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/26)**

can use command_line_README.md (which doesn't match slide)
or use actual slide

## Setting up the "subl." command
***slide 27***  **[SHOW](http://techtalentsouth.slides.com/techtalentsouth/intro-to-programming-code-immersion-1093?token=bnzM3gB7#/0/27)**

##Homework
Recreate the file structure and answer the questions. Submit a picture of the file tree along with any answers in a `.txt` file. Complete the first two lessons of [CodeCademy - Learn the command-line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

***PRO TIP***  
*You know your students and their progress. Feel free to come up with homework of your own that aligns with the students current needs*
